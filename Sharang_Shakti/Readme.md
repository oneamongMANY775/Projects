During my tenure, my responsibilities spanned rapid hardware prototyping, distributed system architecture, exploratory R&D, and cross-functional hardware-firmware integration.

* **Rapid Hardware Development:** Spearheaded the hardware design for the drone's edge computing capabilities. Successfully designed, routed, and validated a custom carrier board for the **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** from scratch within 4-month timeline.
* **Distributed System Architecture:** Redesigned the core drone architecture to optimize processing bandwidth. I successfully offloaded critical compute from the main flight controller by introducing a dedicated gimbal controller and integrating a localized microcontroller directly onto the Power Distribution Board (PDB).
* **Cross-Functional RTOS Integration:** Worked closely with the firmware engineering team to facilitate a critical system transition from a legacy ISR-based codebase to a modern **RTOS-based architecture**.
* **Embedded Linux & Vision R&D:** Led exploratory research into embedded Linux and NVIDIA's **DeepStream SDK** to evaluate the feasibility of a custom, GPU-accelerated vision pipeline. After comprehensive testing, I conducted a strategic R&D assessment and advised leadership to pivot resources toward next-generation board development, ensuring engineering hours were allocated to the highest-ROI tasks.
