### 📈 Business & Strategic Leadership

**Team Kratos Racing | Formula Bharat**

In addition to technical engineering, I led the team’s commercial strategy for the **Formula Student Business Plan Presentation**.

* **The Event:** In the Formula Student format, teams are required to operate as a fictional startup pitching their prototype racecar to executive investors. The objective is to develop a comprehensive, scalable, and profitable business model that justifies the mass manufacturing and marketing of the product.
* **The Challenge:** Historically, our team excelled in engineering but struggled with a four-year drought with zero podium finishes in the business event.
* **The Strategy:** I completely overhauled our approach and came up with a new system based on the feedback received from the judges and other who were winning. I drove improvements in our financial forecasting, market analysis, and presentation delivery, ensuring our pitch resonated with the "investor" judges.
* **The Result:** Successfully led the team to break the four-year drought, securing **2nd Runner-Up (All India Rank 3)** in the 2025 season of Formula Bharat.
